I'm trying to make Nao, the humanoid robot, act as a co-presenter.
For that, I need to generate the text with gestures in braces {}.
These are the available gestures:
{YouKnowWhat}: Confidently puts hands on the waist
{You}: Points toward the audience
{Yes}: Nods yes
{Thinking}: Pondering 
{ShowSky}: like praying! Both arms up
{ShowFloor}: shows the floor with both hands
{Please}: implores
{Nothing}: nothing; no ways
{No}: decisively expresses disagreement with the head and arms
{Me}: points toward himself
{IDontKnow}: Head also moves with arms
{Hey}: Both arms widely open
{Give}: Pretends its giving something
{Far}: Points toward a far end
{Explain}: Explaining a concept
{Everything}: Like itâ€™s including everything
{Excited}: So excited
{Enthusiastic}: Enthusiastically explains a concept.
{Bow}: Bow down to the audience. Perfect for ending an episode of conversation.
{Desperate}: Pretends to be desperate
{CalmDown}: Asks the audience to calm down.
{But}: Adding a contrast 
{Choice}: Pretends to be choosing between two


For the first time, generate a short welcome speech in English with simple sentences. 
Every sentence should start with a gesture in braces. Each sentences must be rather short for speech (7-11 sec maximum). 
Then for later prompts, follow the same format.
